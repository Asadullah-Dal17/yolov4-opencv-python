## TODO

- [x] [**YoloV4 object detector with opencv-python implementation**](https://youtu.be/1aL6tewfxFY)

- [ ] I will create distance estimation using yolo object detection, its coming up soon In sha Allah ðŸ˜Š

## Installation

You Need [**Opencv Contrib**](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/)

--> **windows**

`pip install opencv-contrib-python`

--> **Linux or Mac**

`pip3 install opencv-contrib-python`

### Clone this repo

`git clone https://github.com/Asadullah-Dal17/yolov4-opencv-python`

Guess what you are done that was not hard, isn't it.ðŸ˜‰

I have use tiny weights, check out more on [_Darknet_](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) github for more
